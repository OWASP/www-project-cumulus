## Contribute

Contributions to Cumulus are very much appreciated.
In the end, this card deck is intended to be a community project.
It should change and evolve in the same pace as cloud technologies and their particular security requirements change.

### Review and discuss

Feedback, reviews and other opinions are very welcome.
This card game is only as helpful as its threats are relevant.
Let's work together to constantly improve the cards!

The best way is to simply create an [issue](https://github.com/OWASP/cumulus/issues) to start a discussion.
But you can also reach out to the project leads.

### Contribute to the cards

Changes to the threat formulations are welcome as pull requests to [cards.tex](https://github.com/OWASP/cumulus/blob/main/cards.tex).

### Contribute to documentation

When writing the threats we tried to condense each security issue into a single sentence.
Although a sufficiently general (but maybe also vague) formulation can foster discussions, it can also hinder beginners to understand the threats.
We would love to provide further explanations and examples to the cards.

Help (in the form of formulating explanations or giving real-world examples) are very much appreciated.
Just contact the project leads.
